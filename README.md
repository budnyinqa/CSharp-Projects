## Number Guessing Game - Project 1
The purpose of this project was straightforward - to create a simple console game. The player’s task is to guess a number randomly generated by the program. The application provides hints by telling the user whether their guess is lower or higher than the target number. The number of attempts is recorded and displayed at the end of the game.

Even though this project is not very advanced, I decided to include it here to document the beginning of my C# journey. I built it after just one month of learning, and it made the learning process both fun and motivating.


### Generating a Random Number and Asking for Input
The full application is implemented entirely within the `Main` method. At the very beginning, a target number is created using the `Random` class. Immediately after generating the number, the program prints a welcome message and instructions, setting the stage for the interactive game, and prepares a list to store all player attempts, enabling later review of guesses.
```C#
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Random randomizer = new Random();
    int random_number = randomizer.Next(0, 5000);

    Console.WriteLine("Hello! Welcome to the number guessing game. Your task is to find a number between 0 and 5000.\nHave Fun :)\n");
    List<int> attempts = new List<int>();
```


### Game Logic
After displaying the welcome message, the player is asked to enter a number. This happens inside a for loop, so if the guess is incorrect, the program continues to ask for another input.

Next, the program verifies whether the input is a valid number. If it is not, an appropriate error message is displayed on the screen:
```C#
for (; ; )
{
    Console.WriteLine("Enter a number:");
    int input_number;
    if (!int.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out input_number))
    {
        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
        Console.WriteLine("\nYou entered a text value. Please try with an integer.");
        Console.ResetColor();
        continue;
    }
```

The last set of `if` statements checks whether the player’s guess is larger, smaller, or equal to the target number. Depending on the comparison, the program responds with a hint or a congratulatory message.
```C#
                if (input_number > random_number)
                {
                    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
                    Console.WriteLine("\nThe target number is smaller. Try another value.");
                }

                else if (input_number < random_number)
                {
                    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
                    Console.WriteLine("\nThe target number is larger. Try another value.");
                }

                if (input_number == random_number)
                {
                    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Green;
                    Console.WriteLine($"\nCongratulations!!!\n{random_number} is the correct value.\nYou guessed it after {attempts.Count} tries, that’s an amazing result!\n");
                    Console.ResetColor();
                    Console.WriteLine($"Here are all your attempts:");
                    attempts.ForEach(attempt => Console.WriteLine(attempt));
                    break;
                }

                Console.ResetColor();

            }
```
Even though the app runs in the console, I wanted it to look good. Therefore, messages are displayed in green or red, depending on their meaning: red for warnings or hints, and green for success or congratulatory messages.

This structure ensures the game provides real-time feedback, guiding the player towards the correct number while keeping track of all attempts for review.

## Currency Converter - Project 2
The purpose of this project was to create a currency converter in the form of a `Windows Forms` application. All objects had to be placed using the designer and assigned appropriate properties. The calculation logic was kept simple, as the exchange rates were stored inside an array. Additionally, the program includes several useful features: a clear button to reset values, a swap button to quickly change the conversion direction, a scroll bar to help select the amount, and a round value checkbox to simplify the output.

Although it is a relatively simple project, it demonstrates my ability to structure code, use arrays effectively, and implement practical UI elements in `Windows Forms`. This project also helped me strengthen my understanding of event-driven programming and the fundamentals of building user-friendly desktop applications.


### Designer
I decided to keep the project minimalistic by using only two primary colors, two fonts, and a picture box to display a custom icon. While placing the individual objects, I assigned each of them a unique name and added events whenever necessary.

### Initialization and Setup
The application begins its execution with the initialization of the main form. A boolean flag `isInitializing` is declared and set to true to indicate that the form is still being set up. This flag is used throughout the code to prevent unnecessary execution of conversion logic while the user interface is not fully initialized. The application sets default values for the input fields and dropdowns. Specifically, the amount textbox `EnterAmount` is initialized to "1", while the source currency dropdown `From` selects the second currency, and the target currency dropdown `To` selects the first currency.
```C#
 public Form1()
 {
     InitializeComponent();

     EnterAmount.Text = "1"; // Sets default value for the amount input
     From.SelectedIndex = 1; // Select the second currency by default
     To.SelectedIndex = 0; // Select the first currency by default

     AmountScrollBar.Scroll += AmountScrollBar_Scroll; // Attach scroll event handler to AmountScrollBar

     isInitializing = false;

     UpdateConversion(); // Perform an conversion update
 }
```
The scrollbar is connected to an event handler to ensure that any change in the scrollbar updates the input amount dynamically. Finally, after the initialization is complete, the `isInitializing` flag is set to false, and the initial conversion is calculated by calling `UpdateConversion()`.


### Currency Convertion Logic
The exchange rates are stored in a two-dimensional array called `exchange_rate`. Each row of this array represents the source currency, while each column corresponds to the target currency.
```C#
private readonly decimal[,] exchange_rate = new decimal[,] // 2D array storing exchange rates between different currencies
{
    {1.0m, 4.25126m, 1.03717m},
    {0.235224m, 1.0m, 0.243978m},
    {0.964161m, 4.10505m, 1.0m}
};
```
To perform the conversion, the method `ConvertCurrency` takes an amount along with the source and target currency indexes. It retrieves the relevant rate from the array and multiplies the amount by this rate.
```C#
private decimal ConvertCurrency(decimal amount, int fromCurrency, int toCurrency)
{
    decimal rate = exchange_rate[fromCurrency, toCurrency]; // Get the exchange rate from the table
    return amount * rate; // Multiply the amount by the rate
}
```
The `UpdateConversion` method orchestrates the process of reading the input, validating it, performing the conversion, rounding the result if requested, and updating the user interface. It first checks the `isInitializing` flag and returns immediately if the form is still being set up. The method then tries to parse the value from `EnterAmount`. If parsing fails, an error message is displayed to the user. 

Using `ConvertCurrency`, the converted value is calculated. If the user has selected the rounding option by the checkbox, the amount is rounded to two decimal places. Finally, the converted value is displayed in the `result2` label, which is horizontally centered on the form, and the conversion rate label is updated.
```C#
result2.Text = $"{amount}{From.Text} = {converted_amount}{To.Text}"; // Display the conversion result in the result label
// Center the result label horizontally in the form
result2.Location = new Point(
    (this.ClientSize.Width - result2.Width) / 2,
    result2.Location.Y);
```


### Interface Interactions
The application responds to several user interactions. The scrollbar movement is linked to the `AmountScrollBar_Scroll` event, which updates the amount textbox in real time. Clicking the GENERATE button triggers a conversion by calling `UpdateConversion()`. 

Users can swap the source and target currencies by clicking on a picture box, which temporarily stores the target currency index, performs the swap.
```C#
private void pictureBox1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    int To_copy = To.SelectedIndex; // Temporarily store the target currency
    // Swap the selections
    To.SelectedIndex = From.SelectedIndex;
    From.SelectedIndex = To_copy;
}
```
Lastly, the CLEAR button resets the form by clearing the amount, deselecting both currencies, moving the scrollbar to its minimum position, and unchecking the rounding checkbox.
```C#
private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    From.SelectedIndex = -1; // Deselect "From" currency
    To.SelectedIndex = -1; // Deselect "To" currency
    EnterAmount.Text = ""; // Clear input field
    Round_checkBox.Checked = false; // Reset checkbox
    AmountScrollBar.Value = AmountScrollBar.Minimum; // Reset scrollbar to its minimum position
}
```
