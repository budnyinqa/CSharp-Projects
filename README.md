## Number Guessing Game - Project 1
The purpose of this project was straightforward - to create a simple console game. The player’s task is to guess a number randomly generated by the program. The application provides hints by telling the user whether their guess is lower or higher than the target number. The number of attempts is recorded and displayed at the end of the game.

Even though this project is not very advanced, I decided to include it here to document the beginning of my C# journey. I built it after just one month of learning, and it made the learning process both fun and motivating.


### Generating a Random Number and Asking for Input
The full application is implemented entirely within the `Main` method. At the very beginning, a target number is created using the `Random` class. Immediately after generating the number, the program prints a welcome message and instructions, setting the stage for the interactive game, and prepares a list to store all player attempts, enabling later review of guesses.
```C#
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Random randomizer = new Random();
    int random_number = randomizer.Next(0, 5000);

    Console.WriteLine("Hello! Welcome to the number guessing game. Your task is to find a number between 0 and 5000.\nHave Fun :)\n");
    List<int> attempts = new List<int>();
```


### Game Logic
After displaying the welcome message, the player is asked to enter a number. This happens inside a for loop, so if the guess is incorrect, the program continues to ask for another input.

Next, the program verifies whether the input is a valid number. If it is not, an appropriate error message is displayed on the screen:
```C#
for (; ; )
{
    Console.WriteLine("Enter a number:");
    int input_number;
    if (!int.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out input_number))
    {
        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
        Console.WriteLine("\nYou entered a text value. Please try with an integer.");
        Console.ResetColor();
        continue;
    }
```

The last set of `if` statements checks whether the player’s guess is larger, smaller, or equal to the target number. Depending on the comparison, the program responds with a hint or a congratulatory message.
```C#
                if (input_number > random_number)
                {
                    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
                    Console.WriteLine("\nThe target number is smaller. Try another value.");
                }

                else if (input_number < random_number)
                {
                    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
                    Console.WriteLine("\nThe target number is larger. Try another value.");
                }

                if (input_number == random_number)
                {
                    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Green;
                    Console.WriteLine($"\nCongratulations!!!\n{random_number} is the correct value.\nYou guessed it after {attempts.Count} tries, that’s an amazing result!\n");
                    Console.ResetColor();
                    Console.WriteLine($"Here are all your attempts:");
                    attempts.ForEach(attempt => Console.WriteLine(attempt));
                    break;
                }

                Console.ResetColor();

            }
```
Even though the app runs in the console, I wanted it to look good. Therefore, messages are displayed in green or red, depending on their meaning: red for warnings or hints, and green for success or congratulatory messages.

This structure ensures the game provides real-time feedback, guiding the player towards the correct number while keeping track of all attempts for review.
